## Abstract L61.00005

Data visualization is critical to understanding data in physics. Visualization
is important in the early stages of understanding a measurement or a model and,
later, in communicating it clearly. Physicists need to produce visualizations
that fit their specific problem, often including multiple axes or novel plot
types. They need tools that make common tasks like scatter and line plots easy
and complex tasks like compound figures possible.

Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific
Python Ecosystem. It is used by working physicists, from high-profile projects
like LIGO and the Event Horizon Telescope. to the day-to-day work of students,
for interactive exploratory visualization and publication-ready figures.

This talk will highlight some of the key features of the library, focusing on
examples of interactive multi-scale visualizations and tuning figures in
preparation for publication. I will also briefly discuss our future plans to
evolve the library to meet the future needs of our users.
