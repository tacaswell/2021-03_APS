# Matplotlib: From exploration to final figure

## Lesson 0: just plot it!

- built in plotting
- pandas plotting
- xarray plotting
- xlabel, ylabel, title, legend
- offset
- wrap it all in a function

Learning goals:

1. how to put lines an screen
2. how to make sure the plot would pass freshman physics lab standards
3. write helper functions  (to do plotting)
4. trivial transforms

## Lesson 1:
- smooth the data
- normalize the data
- fit the data
- capture results
- plot the reduced data
- label with latex + legend

Learning goals:

1. data reduction (it is all just arrays!)
2. use of structured data (xarray, pandas) to track results
3. write helper functions (to do reduction)

## Lesson 2:
- plot the offset data labeled with derived values

Learning Goals:

1. ax.annotation exists and is very powerful
2. (built in) latex support exists
3. (usetex) latex support exists
4. write helper functions  (to do plotting)

## Lesson 3:

- put the axes from Lesson 2 and Lesson 1 in same figure
- use subplots
- use add_axes
- use subplot_mosaic
- use constrained_layout
- adjust figure size

Learning Goals:

1. Figure layout tools
2. write helper function to make paper figure
